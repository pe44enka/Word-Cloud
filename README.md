## Word Cloud

### Description 
This notebook is created as a part of **Crush course on Python** by Google and supposed to create a Word Cloud based on frequency of words appearance in the text on website.

### Objectives
Can you guess a poem or a novel just by looking at most frequent words in it? Or maybe its genre at least? Let's give it a try!
A *Word Cloud* is an image that's made up of different sized words. Usually the sizes of the words are determined by how many times each word appears in a specific text.

### Goal of the project
To create a Word Cloud of the most frequently used words in a given text.

### Data
[Wuthering Heights by Emily BrontÃ«](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/768/768-0.txt) available as part of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org)

### Library
In this project following libraries are used:
* **Data collecting:** urllib
* **Data processing:** nltk
* **Word cloud creation:** wordcloud
* **Word cloud vizualization:** matplotlib 

### Installation:
You shouldn't really install this code, just click on the "WordCloud.ipynb" file and in the follow window click on "Open in Colab" button. This will redirect you on [Colab](colab.research.google.com) by Google website.
